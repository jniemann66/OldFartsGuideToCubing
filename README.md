# Old Fart's Guide To Cubing
Old Fart's guide to Cubing - solving cube puzzles with minimal knowledge

There is no software in this repository. It contains a guide for solving Rubik's cubes in a most clumsy and inefficient way. This guide contains a distillation of a minimal set of algorithms required to solve 3x3x3, 4x4x4,  and 5x5x5 Rubik's cubes.

The motivation behind it was to have a handy reference available to consult whenever I pick up a Rubik's cube to play with (which typically happens every 3 years or so :-) ). As I am an old fart (not like these young whippersnappers of today), I am woeful at remembering algorithms, and I wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of remembering the the 57 OLLs and 21 PLLs used by typical speedsolvers of today.

The information in the guide should provide just enough knowledge to solve cubes (slowly) and maybe impress your family and friends for about two minutes. (I doubt it would be impressive enough to get you laid, and may even have the opposite effect, but you never know ...)

This is not intended to be a method for speed-cubing, but rather just a really basic, clumsy way of solving cubes.
The knowledge for a 3x3x3 cube is presented first, and then additional knowledge required for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 is progressively introduced. Some knowledge of how to get the cross and first layer of a 3x3x3 cube is assumed, as is cube notation. There are endless resources on the net for this.

I hope someone finds this useful. I know I will be using it again in a few years, next time I wipe the dust off my old cubes and start playing with them when I am supposed to be spring-cleaning.

Any comments/improvements/edits/suggestions welcome.
